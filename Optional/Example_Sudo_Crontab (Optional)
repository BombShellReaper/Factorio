# Edit this file to introduce tasks to be run by cron.
#
# Each task to run has to be defined through a single line
# indicating with different fields when the task will be run
# and what command to run for the task.
#
# To define the time, you can provide concrete values for
# minute (m), hour (h), day of month (dom), month (mon),
# and day of week (dow), or use '*' in these fields (for 'any').
#
# Notice that tasks will be started based on the cron's system
# daemon's notion of time and timezones.
#
# Output of the crontab jobs (including errors) is sent through
# email to the user the crontab file belongs to (unless redirected).
#
# For example, you can run a backup of all your user accounts
# at 5 a.m every week with:
# 0 5 * * 1 tar -zcf /var/backups/home.tgz /home/
#
# For more information, see the manual pages of crontab(5) and cron(8)
#
# m h  dom mon dow   command

# Task 1: Custom Task Name (e.g., Update, Backup, etc.)
# Example: Run a server reboot script daily at 2 a.m.
# Customize the command and timing below:
0 2 * * * /path/to/your/script.sh   # Replace with your script location

# Additional tasks can be added below. Remember to follow the format:
# m h dom mon dow command

# Example: Run a task every day at 3 a.m.
# 0 3 * * * /path/to/another/script.sh
